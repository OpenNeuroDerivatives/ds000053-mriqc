    "TaskDescription": "This phase was designed to use feedback to modify risk preferences as participants decided whether to accept or reject a stock for one of two clients, specified by a pre-trial cue. Participants were asked to review stocks with one of the two clients and then suggest that client whether to accept or reject the stock into the client's investment portfolio. In the beginning of every trial, for 1 second the participants saw a cue indicating which client they would be advising on that trial. Then, they saw a stock with a 50/50 chance to win or lose specific amounts of money. They had up to 2.5 seconds to decide whether they would suggest the client to accept or reject that stock by pressing buttons. Immediately after the participants responded, they saw the number of reward points that they earned or lost from the client for 1.5 seconds.",
