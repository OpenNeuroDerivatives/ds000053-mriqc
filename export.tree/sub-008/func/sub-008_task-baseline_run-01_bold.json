    "TaskDescription": "Participants saw a set of stocks offering 50/50 chances to either win or lose a certain amount of money. They had to press one of the four buttons to indicate whether they strongly accept, weakly accept, weakly reject, or strongly reject each stock into their own investment portfolio in 2.5 seconds. The trial was aborted if no response was made within this time window. At the end of this phase, one of the trials was randomly selected and its outcome was revealed. If the participant previously accepted this selected stock, a Bernoulli trial with probability 0.5 would determine the payoff according to the amount of potential gains and potential losses offering by this stock. If the participant rejected this selected stock or did not respond within the time window, the payoff would be zero. The outcome of this selected stock then became the initial number of reward points for the participants to continue collecting reward points in the next phase.",
