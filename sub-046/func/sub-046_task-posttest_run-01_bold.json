    "TaskDescription": "This phase was designed to evaluate how the previous experience in the two decision contexts would influence the participants' decision-making under risk without the guidance of immediate feedback. The timeline was the same as in the previous phase, except that 1) no feedback was presented, and 2) the stimuli in each decision context were the same set of stocks used in the first phase. The participants were requested to maximize their reward points that were accumulated in the background by applying what they had learned about each client's preference when making a suggestion. The decision criterion and payment structure in each context was exactly the same as in the training phase. At the end of the probe phase, the total reward points that were collected by the participant over the three phases was converted into a bonus and added to the subjectâ€™s base compensation (500 reward points = 1 USD).",
